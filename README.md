## Some Screenshots



## Acknowledgments

 I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the following resources and individuals:

- [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for providing the free API used in this project to fetch accurate weather data.
- [BGJar](https://bgjar.com/) for providing high-quality free SVG images used for dynamic background animations in the web application.

## Easter?!

Small details you might not notice.


* **SVG Backgrounds** : If you look well, you might notice that the background changes based on cities with respect to their temperatures. It's just two for now (less than 30 degrees = Snow, More than 30 degrees = Cloudy), Expecting to add more in the future.
* **Known issue** : World map svg is supposed to be the default background but the webpage just refreshes so soon moving it to the animated background.
